# Education

__PhD Informatics__ at [AIAI](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/aiai), School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh  
_Sep 2020 - Apr 2025_  
_Thesis_: [A Formalised Approach to the Composition of Processes over Linear Resources](http://dx.doi.org/10.7488/era/6213)  
My work revolved around process composition, linear logic and mechanisation in Isabelle/HOL and was supervised by Prof. Jacques Fleuriot and Prof. Jane Hillston.
Throughout this programme I have been a member of the [AI Modelling Lab](https://aiml.inf.ed.ac.uk/) and I have been involved in a variety of other projects that make use of formal methods.

# Employment

__Post-Doctoral Research Associate__ at the [AIM-CISC, Usher Institute](https://usher.ed.ac.uk/aim-cisc)  
_November 2025 - Present_

I am a research associate on [Objective 4](https://usher.ed.ac.uk/aim-cisc/meet-the-team/objective-4) of the AIM-CISC project.
My focus is on using process mining to analyse inpatient data originating from [DataLoch](https://dataloch.org/).

__Post-Doctoral Research Associate__ at the [Advanced Care Research Centre](https://usher.ed.ac.uk/advanced-care-research-centre)  
_May 2025 - October 2025_

I was one of several research associates working on [Integrated Technologies of Care](https://usher.ed.ac.uk/advanced-care-research-centre/programme/new-technologies-of-care).
The team I was a part of uses formal models that integrate sensor data and information about a person's context to understand the activities they perform, with the aim of improving quality of life for older adults.
My individual focus was on visualising the various data in a dashboard to make it accessible to a less technical audience.
The dashboard is implemented with [Plotly Dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash) and uses [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) to make building formal constraints more accessible.

__Teaching Support__ at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh  
_AYs 2020/21, 2021/22, 2022/23, 2024/25_

Over each of these academic years I provided teaching support on the courses _Automated Reasoning_ and _Logic, Computability and Incompleteness_, filling at different times the roles of tutor, lab demonstrator, marker and teaching assistant.
As part of these posts I supported the students and the course organisers by leading the labs and tutorials, answering questions online and in person, maintaining the course web page, marking the assignments and delivering several lectures.

__Research Intern__ at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh  
_Jun 2019 - Aug 2020_

I worked on projects with Prof. Jacques Fleuriot, mainly on the [DigiFlow](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ppapapan/digiflow/) project and on mechanisations in Isabelle/HOL.
This work includes implementation, exploring potential research directions, formalisation and proof mechanisation, and technical writing.

_Technologies used_: Java, Scala, Isabelle/HOL  
_Theoretical topics_: &pi;-Calculus, Classical Linear Logic, Event Stream Processing

__Housekeeper__ at Glenalmond House, Edinburgh  
_Jun - Sep 2018_

__Junior Developer__ at Orchitech solutions s.r.o, Prague  
_Jun - Aug 2017_

I was tasked with organisational work on the Wren Security open-source repositories and with enhancements to their version of OpenIdM.

_Technologies used_: Java, Maven, Git, Apache Felix, OSGi  

__Lecturer__ at Labyrint, Kladno  
_Oct 2014 - Jun 2016_

I taught a full-year programming course for children (around 12 years old) where we focused on Java, and two short term (2-3 months) courses for adults focusing on MS Office suite and its use in the workplace.

_Tasks_: preparing exercises, helping with problems outside of classes (school IT assignments or work assignments), minor administrative tasks

__Web Developer__ at Fix Software  
_Apr - Sep 2015_

I was responsible for building the administration backend of a website for an accounting association.
That included article, eshop, and account management with multiple levels of user permissions.
I also designed the database structure to hold the data needed and integrated the backend into the public frontend.

_Technologies used_: Php, MySQL, HTML, Joomla, JavaScript
