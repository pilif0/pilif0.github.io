I am a PhD student at the [Artificial Intelligence and its Applications Institute](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/aiai), School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh.
My supervisor is [Jacques Fleuriot](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jdf/) and I am a member of [The AI Modelling Lab](https://aiml.inf.ed.ac.uk/).

My main work revolves around theorem proving in [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/).
The result of my bachelor's project is a mechanisation of [Hyperdual Numbers](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Hyperdual.html), formally verifying forward automatic differentiation.
As part of my PhD I am mechanising a [framework](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10817-024-09698-2) for process composition with a focus on linear resources.
More generally, I am also quite interested in mechanisations that result in generation of verified and practical code.

In my off time I like to play complex simulation games with deep systems and emergent gameplay.
This includes factory simulators (Factorio, Satisfactory), survival simulators (Oxygen Not Included) and management simulators (Dwarf Fortress).
I also regularly play TTRPGS (Dungeons & Dragons, Blades in the Dark) and love board games.
