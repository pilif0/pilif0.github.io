I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Edinburgh working with the [Advanced Care Research Centre](https://usher.ed.ac.uk/advanced-care-research-centre).
I finished my PhD at the [Artificial Intelligence and its Applications Institute](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/aiai) in 2025 under the supervision of [Jacques Fleuriot](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jdf/).

My main research interests revolve around formal methods, especially theorem proving with [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/).
The result of my bachelor's project is a mechanisation of [Hyperdual Numbers](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Hyperdual.html), formally verifying their use in forward automatic differentiation.
As part of my PhD I mechanised a [framework](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10817-024-09698-2) for process composition with a focus on linear resources.
More generally, I am also quite interested in mechanisations that result in generation of verified yet practical code.

In my off time I like to play complex simulation games with deep systems and emergent gameplay.
This includes factory simulators (Factorio, Satisfactory), survival simulators (Oxygen Not Included) and management simulators (Dwarf Fortress).
I also regularly play TTRPGS (Dungeons & Dragons, Blades in the Dark) and love board games.
